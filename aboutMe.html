                    <header><h3><u>About Me</u></h3></header>
                    <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" style="text-decoration: none;color: black;">City University of Hong Kong</a>
                         majoring in Business Economics in 2017. After my graduation, I started my career in banking industry.
                         I started to work at Hang Seng Bank as Global Markets Operations Officer from August 2017 to Apr 2019,
                         mainly responsible for treasury product settlement. This valuable experience equipped me with basic 
                         treasury product knowledge which also fueled my interest in capital markets.                               
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Knowing I was interested in developing my career in this field, I came across with a job opportunity 
                       to work in a treasury department at Bank of East Asia which allowed me to gain much more exposures 
                       to the field. Working at Bank of East Asia enabled me to build a better understanding to the market and their
                       products by analyzing credit risks of each corporate that we target and constantly monitoring the market sentiment.

                    <p>
                        During my work at the bank, a great deal of data had to be analyzed so as to conclude a logical 
                        and reasonable decision for our trading strategies. To deal with a staggering amount of data, 
                        I decided to learn a simple programming language to alleviate my workload which subsequently 
                        inspired my interest in programming skills. Therefore, I decided to pursue a diploma at Humber 
                        College in order to strengthen my technique and seek career advancement after obtaining the 
                        academic qualification.
